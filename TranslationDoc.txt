Transfer the player to the dynamic object.
Transfer from wall/ceiling/floor to the border.
Turn the aBody into its own file? maybe not needed now.

BoxWorld is the manager for the Physics?
StatBody and DynBody can be essentially removed? 
 - Replace StatBody with aBody.
 - DynBody would be the player.
