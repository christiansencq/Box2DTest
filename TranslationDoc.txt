Further separate Components:
    Have a base PhysicsComponent class (not like current PhysicsComponent class)
    Change current PhysicsComponent to: PhysicsBodyComponent?
    Create SensorComponent, StaticBodyComponent, KinematicBodyComponent
    
    Separate out ShapeComponent from a ShapeDrawerComponent?
        ShapeComponent will dictate PhysicsComponent/s ShapeDrawerComponent, CollisionComponent, etc.
    
    All entities will initialize with a Shape assigned to a member varaiable.

From this:

Transfer the player to the dynamic object.
Transfer from wall/ceiling/floor to the border.
Turn the aBody into its own file? maybe not needed now.

PhysicsState is analogous to Level

BoxWorld is the manager for the Physics?
StatBody and DynBody can be essentially removed? 
 - Replace StatBody with aBody.
 - DynBody would be the player.
