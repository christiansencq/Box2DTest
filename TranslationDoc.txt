Merge the BoxWorld and the Physicsstate - no need for them to be separate
 at this point.  World only has the gravity and the b2World.

Separate Out PhysicsComponent from Entity.  

Try to make a Bounce or Adding a Force

Then work on a visual display, or a binary input that allows a force to be exerted.

Transfer the player to the dynamic object.
Transfer from wall/ceiling/floor to the border.
Turn the aBody into its own file? maybe not needed now.

PhysicsState is analogous to Level

BoxWorld is the manager for the Physics?
StatBody and DynBody can be essentially removed? 
 - Replace StatBody with aBody.
 - DynBody would be the player.
